# aaltodimensions

For Aalto University publications published 2015-2017, queries citations metrics from the [Dimensions API](http://dimensions.ai), and OA full text availability from the Unpaywall API via [roadoi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roadoi/index.html). Finally, builds an [R Shiny web app](https://ttso.shinyapps.io/aaltodimensions/). Includes also the Web of Science citation count.

Publication metadata by the [VIRTA REST API](https://confluence.csc.fi/display/VIR/REST-lukurajapinta), and organisational data by [Aalto University CRIS](http://research.aalto.fi).
